# Introductions

This document follows a certain format that you can use as a base framework for your game, but also offers design advice so that you can hack it while still keeping the HOPES & DREAMS feeling.

You can fill-in the gaps, or tear-it down to make something completely different.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this. Enjoy!

# The Game

In this game, you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional characters facing, and trying to overcome obstacles. You decide how the characters resolve those challenges, and how the world reacts to those actions.

## What You Need To Play

Here’s what you’ll need to play:

- Between two and five friends to play with one acting as the Game Master.
- Character sheets, one for each player.
- A bunch of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- Index cards, sticky notes or similar slips of paper.

## Content Warning

We want to take a moment to be transparent about the themes present in this game. If some of them make you or anyone at your table uncomfortable, it's important to talk about it as a group. You can then decide to either remove them from your game or play something else. Stay safe and be empathetic with everyone you are playing with.

This game includes references and expressions of the following themes: [...]

> #### Designer Note: Content Warning
>
> Take the time to fill out the themes present in your game with the section above. Being transparent will go a long way to ensure a safe playing experience for everyone at the table.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or `NPCs`.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or `PCs`.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful, and captivating.

## Game Structure

To play this game, you meet-up with other people either in real life or online to collaborate on creating an interesting story together.

Each `session` is its own unique experience and is made of multiple `scenes` stitched together, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what their characters do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of dice rolls.

We roll dice because we want to be on the edge of our seats. We want to be surprised by where the story takes us next.

## Safety Tools

Safety at the table is very important, which is why we think that you should establish a couple of **Lines and Veils** before you start playing.

**Lines** are allow everyone in the group to define what topics should never come up in the game. **Veils** ensures that whilst an action or event might take place, it will happen ‘off-screen’: mentioned in passing, but not dwelled on in detail.

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important, and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

# Character Creation

To make your character, write down their name, their nickname, and what they look like on your character sheet.

## Actions

The way your character interacts with the world is via their `ACTIONS`. When a PC wants to do something risky, they use one of the 12 `ACTIONS` listed below to try and resolve the situation.

> #### Designer Notes: Hacking The Actions
> 
> In HOPES & DREAMS, characters have the following 12 actions: muscle, finesse, move, sneak, shoot, tinker, study, notice, bond, command, sway, focus. An easy way to make this game your own is to change the default action list to something that better fits your theme.
> 
> If you use less than 12 actions, you might want to reduce the number of actions characters are skilled in at the start of the game

- `MUSCLE`: wreck, move, force.
- `FINESSE`: maneuver, misguide, fool.
- `MOVE`: run, jump, swim, climb.
- `SNEAK`: hide, skulk, lurk.
- `SHOOT`: track, throw, shoot.
- `TINKER`: build, repair, hijack.
- `STUDY`: gather information, analyze, scrutinize.
- `NOTICE`: perceive, observe, anticipate.
- `BOND`: reassure, socialize, connect.
- `COMMAND`: lead, order, intimidate.
- `SWAY`: influence, charm, manipulate.
- `FOCUS`: concentrate, calculate, mediate.

All characters have actions they excel at, this is called being `SKILLED`. Characters are skilled in 3 `ACTIONS` in total.

To decide which action your character is `SKILLED` at, you first choose a KIT.

`KITS` are character presets that come with 2 `SKILLED ACTIONS` and special `ABILITIES` that you can use to make powerful stunts.

Once you’ve chosen a `KIT`, you get to decide what is the last action your character is skilled at.

## Kits

This games includes {N} KITS for the players to choose from. You can either be a: 

> #### Designer Notes: Making Kits
> 
> KITS are like HOPES & DREAMS’ playbooks. They show the readers what your game is about, and what kind of characters the players will play as. Use this as a way to convey your game’s theme as much as possible.
> 
> To make a KIT, give them a name, define ACTIONS they are skilled at and give them a couple of ABILITIES.
> 
> ABILITIES are like the talents of a KIT. They can give new narrative permissions to a character. But can also make them stronger or more resistant by giving a +1 IMPACT or -1 COST bonus to a roll in specific circumstances.

## Hopes

The `HOPE` of a character is used to represent what fuels them to achieve their goals. Characters get `HOPE` when they succeed risky actions. Players can then decide to spend that `HOPE` to get bonuses when facing new challenges. 

The easiest way to track `HOPE` is to use physical tokens like poker chips or beads, but you can also use the `HOPE TRACK` available on the character sheet

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING HOPES
> HOPES is what fuels the characters in the story. It helps push the narrative forward so that the PCs can eventually reach their goal, and achieve their DREAMS. 
> 
> You should look into renaming this so that it better fits your game’s aesthetic.

## Dreams

Once everyone has a general idea of what kind of character they are going to play, you all need to decide on what is the main short-term goal of the group. In this game, we call this the group’s `DREAM`.

The `DREAM` is what drives the characters forward in the story. This isn’t something that is given to them, it’s something that drives them and ignites their hearts.

Once you’ve chosen a `DREAM`, one of the players can write it down on their character sheet for safe keeping. That character is called the HEART OF THE GROUP. They aren’t the leader, but they are responsible for keeping the group’s `DREAM` alive.

Some of the game’s mechanics mark boxes on the `DREAM` TRACK to represent the progress that the group is making towards their `DREAM`.
When the group's `DREAM TRACK` is completed, the GM fast forwards in time and narrates how the story and the world changed thanks to the PCs. Accomplishing a `DREAM` also gives all the PCs a new `ABILITY` that they can choose from their respective `KITS`.

After that, the group finds a new `DREAM`, and a different character can be the new `HEART OF THE GROUP`. 

Then, the cycle starts over.

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING DREAMS
> 
> A dream is the group’s short-term goal. It aligns everyone on the path to take. Plus, they have the group’s leader who’s there to make sure the goal is never forgotten. 
> 
> Fulfilling the group’s dream is not just important for the story, but it is also important mechanically. 
> 
> It is the only way players will see their characters grow stronger, since fulfilling a DREAM rewards a new ABILITY to every member of the group.

## Harm

When a PC gets hurt or stressed as a result of one of their actions, they take `HARM`. Each character has an `HARM TRACK` with 5 boxes to represent how injured they are.

If at any point your `HARM TRACK` is filled, you are taken out and the rest of the scene continues without you. When the scene is over, clear the track and explain how you recover.

The only way to recover from `HARM` is in-fiction. You can either rest, lay low or seek medical attention. When doing so, the GM will look at the fiction and tell you how much (1-5) you recover.

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING HARM
> 
> Harm is the main challenge pacing mechanism for the game. The GM can inflict it on a player when they fail, or get a partial success, as they attempt dangerous actions.
> 
> If you want to make the characters feel stronger or weaker, you can adjust the length of the harm track. Remember that failing a risky action can mark 1 box of harm, while failing a desperate one could mean marking 2. Take this in consideration and test your changes until you get the proper feeling for how you want the characters to feel in your game. In doubt, we still consider 5 boxes to be a good default value.
> 
> To change the way harm work, you could also include more than one harm track, depending on what your game is about. Doing this will let you spread the pace over multiple tracks.

## Abilities

A character’s `ABILITIES` are special talents that are unique to each KIT. They either give a mechanical advantage in certain situations, or allow a new narrative liberty.

Each character starts with 1 `ABILITY`. Each time the group's `DREAM` is achieved, all characters gain a new `ABILITY`.

# Mechanics

## Tests & Challenges

During scenes, the PCs might encounter risky situations that they will try to resolve. Some might be handled quickly, while others may require more effort.

Simple tasks are called `TESTS` and are resolved with a single dice `CHECK`. The GM explains the risk, dice are rolled, results are interpreted and we move on.

Complex tasks are called `CHALLENGES` and require multiple `CHECKS` before they are resolved. After the GM has explained what the `CHALLENGES` is, the group is going to do numerous dice rolls until the challenge is complete.

To track the progress of a `CHALLENGE`, we create a TRACK of boxes which the PCs fill as they work towards resolving that obstacle.

## Tracks

In this game, enemies don’t have hit points, abilities or powers. They are merely viewed as obstacles that need to be overcome. To represent those obstacles, we use `TRACKS`.

A `TRACK` is a row with 3, 5, 8 or 13 boxes that you mark from left to right. Every time you check off a box, the track is one step closer to being resolved.

There are two types of `TRACKS`.

- CHALLENGE TRACKS are used to represent challenges that the group needs to handle, like fighting a group of enemies or entering a well secured compound.
- DANGER TRACKS are used for escalating threats like a group of guards that is about to be alerted by your presence, or the time left until a bomb explodes.

## Checks

When a player character tries to do something risky, we make a `CHECK` to determine how it plays out. If what the PC is trying to accomplish is something we would just expect them to do, there is no need for a `CHECK`. The GM just narrates what happens, and the story moves forward.

To make a `CHECK`, you assemble a pool of six sided dice to try to beat an opposed pool assembled by the GM.

First, you need to agree with the GM on which of the `12 ACTIONS` is being used.

Once that is done, the GM prepares a `RISK POOL` while the player prepares their `ACTION POOL`.

### Player's Action Pool

The `ACTION POOL` represents the effort of the PC to overcome a task.

- You start with `1d6`.
- If your character is `SKILLED` in the chosen `ACTION`, add `+1d6`.
- You can also `FILL YOUR HEART WITH HOPE`. Spend `1 HOPE` for an additional `+1d6`.

### GM’S Risk Pool

To build a `RISK POOL`, the GM looks at the fiction and evaluates the risk tied to the action and runs their decision with the rest of the group to make sure everyone agrees.

- For a risky action, use 1d6.
- For a desperate action, use 2d6.
- For a hopeless action, use 3d6.

> ### Assist
>
> If you want to `ASSIST` a fellow PC, describe how you do it and give `+1 IMPACT` or `-1 COST` to their final result.
> By doing this, you also expose yourself to the possible `CONSEQUENCES` that results of their action.

### Interpreting The Result

When everyone is ready, roll the dice and compare the single highest result of your `ACTION POOL` against the result of the GM’s `RISK POOL`.

- If your result is higher, you get a `PAYOFF` and `+1 HOPE` if you didn't spend any for this action.
- On a tie, you get a `PAYOFF` for your action, but there's a `CONSEQUENCE`.
- If your result is lower, your action didn't work and there's a `CONSEQUENCE`.

> ### Which Risk To Pick
>
> By default, if a player is making an `CHECK`, the situation is risky. In some occasions, you can use a desperate pool but doing it often or going higher than that will make the odds heavily against the players
>
> When in doubt, look at the fiction, but keep this in mind when building your `RISK POOL`.

## Non-Player Character

In this game, NPCs don't roll for their actions. NPCs succeed unless the players attempt to stop them, in which case the action roll does double-duty: it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved.

The result tells us about the impact and the cost of an action at the same time, encouraging players to be active participants in the story.

## Payoffs & Consequences

After a `CHECK`, we use the number of dice from each pool as a rating to determine the outcome of the action.

The size of your `ACTION POOL` is called the `{IMPACT}`, and is used to determine the effect of a successful action.

The size of the `RISK POOL` is called the `{COST}`, and is used to determine the strength of a consequence prompted by an action.

### Payoffs

When you get a `PAYOFF`, you get what you want. The player chooses one from the following list:

- For a simple `CHECK`, you get what you want.
- If there's a `CHALLENGE TRACK` in play, mark boxes matching the `{IMPACT}`.
- If the fiction allows it, reduce tension of a future action. Remove `-1d6` to the `RISK POOL` for one upcoming `CHECK`.

### Consequences

When there’s a `CONSEQUENCE`, something bad happens. The GM chooses one from the following list:

- Introduce something new and dangerous in the fiction.
- If there's a `DANGER TRACK` in play, mark boxes matching the `{COST}`.
- Inflict `HARM` matching the `{COST}`.
- If the fiction allows it, increase tension of a future action. Add `+1d6` to the `RISK POOL` for one upcoming `CHECK`.

### Zero Cost & Reduced Consequences

Some of the game’s mechanics affect the `{IMPACT}` and the `{COST}` of a roll either positively or negatively. Which means there will be occasions where an action can have a `{COST}` of zero. When that happens, look at the fiction and use a `REDUCED CONSEQUENCE`.

For example, if you were thinking about marking HARM, look into marking a `DANGER TRACK` instead. If you were planning to mark a `DANGER TRACK` already, introduce new threats in the fiction.

Go with what feels right according to what has already been established.

# Before We Start...

Here are a couple of tips and tricks you should read before you start playing the game.

## For GMs

- **Be a fan of the players.** You aren’t there to trap them or see them lose. You are there to help facilitate an interesting story. Be on the edge of your seat when they are challenged, and cheer when they succeed! 
- **Don’t plan, play.** You don’t need to spend hours planning all the details of each and every session. No plan survives an encounter with the players, so save yourself some time and play to find out what happens instead. 
- **When in doubt, ask questions.** The players have tons of wonderful ideas if you just listen to them. It’s OK to not know about everything. Ask your players questions and fill the world with their answers. 
- **This is a game, not a simulation.** Everyone is here to have fun, so try to stay away from hyper-realism. If it looks cool and feels like it could be possible, let the players try. The dice will help guide you towards the rest of the story.

## For Players

- **Let everyone have their moment.** Everyone enjoys it when their character does something cool and the spotlight is on them. So for that reason, try to make sure everyone at the table gets a fair amount of screen time! 
- **You are a writer, not a spectator.** The GM will help guide the story, but you are as much a part of the writing process as them. Embrace this narrative control and fill out the world with your ideas. 
- **Take risks.** This isn’t like real life, you’re allowed to play dangerously. The only thing that will come out of you doing so, is a fantastic story. Don't be scared of engaging with the fiction. 
- **Rise up.** When your character takes actions, they might fail or consequences might arise. But that’s OK, failure and consequences make for a more interesting story. When at first you don't succeed, get back up and try again using a new approach.
## Balancing Tracks

`TRACKS` are the core pacing mechanism in the game and understanding how their boxes are marked is crucial in understanding how to balance the challenges and treats in a session.

Players will generally want to make `CHECKS` when they are `SKILLED`. That means that the `{IMPACT}` of their roll will often be between 2 or 3.

On the other end, the GM will often have a `RISK POOL` with a `{COST}` of 1, sometimes 2 and rarely 3.

This discrepancy in favor of the player in there for statistical reasons. Though it means that the size of `CHALLENGE TRACKS` and `DANGER TRACKS` should be adjusted accordingly.

Making a `DANGER TRACK` with 8 segments will take a very long time to fill, while a CHALLENGE TRACK with only 3 segments will quickly be resolved by the players.

Generally speaking, to keep things relatively balanced, `DANGER TRACK`S should have between 3, 5 or 8 boxes.

For `CHALLENGE TRACKS`, you can easily go up to 5, 8 or even 13 boxes.

This is simply a guideline so you can consider this a good starting point when using `TRACKS`.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The number of boxes for **TRACKS** aren’t arbitrary. They follow the Fibonacci Sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc) where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The reason for this is that according to Weber’s Law, the difference we can identify between objects is given by a percentage. If that percentage is too low, differentiating two things becomes harder.

By making each **TRACK** size around 60% bigger than the previous one, deciding each one to use becomes easier. Doing this speeds up the game and keeps the group focused on what is important; the fiction.
