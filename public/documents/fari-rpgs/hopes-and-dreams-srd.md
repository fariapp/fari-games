# Introductions

This document follows a certain format that you can use as a base framework for your game, but also offers design advice so that you can hack it while still keeping the HOPES & DREAMS feeling.

You can fill-in the gaps, or tear-it down to make something completely different.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this. Enjoy!

# The Game

In this game, you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional characters facing, and trying to overcome obstacles. You decide how the characters resolve those challenges, and how the world reacts to those actions.

## What You Need To Play

Here’s what you’ll need to play:

- Between two and five friends to play with one acting as the **Game Master**.
- **Character sheets**, one for each player.
- A couple of **six-sided dice**. At least 6 would be ideal.
- Some **tokens** to track _Hope_ (poker chips, beads, pennies, etc.)
- **Index cards**, sticky notes or similar slips of paper.

## Content Warning

We want to take a moment to be transparent about the themes present in this game. If some of them make you or anyone at your table uncomfortable, it's important to talk about it as a group. You can then decide to either remove them from your game or play something else. Stay safe and be empathetic with everyone you are playing with.

This game includes references and expressions of the following themes: [...]

> #### Designer Note: Content Warning
>
> Take the time to fill out the themes present in your game with the section above. Being transparent will go a long way to ensure a safe playing experience for everyone at the table.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the **Game Master**, or GM. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that aren't directly played by the rest of the table. We call those characters "non-player characters", or NPCs.

The rest of the group are **Players**. The players impersonate a Dreamer, their character, which experiences compelling stories inside the continent of this world. We refer to them as player characters, or PCs.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

Everybody contributes to make the story successful, and captivating.

## Dreamers

In this game, players play as **Dreamers**, young adults who want to ignite a revolution so that their life can be better, even though everyone else seem to have abandoned such hope.

## Game Structure

Each **session** is made of **scenes**, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what their characters do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of dice rolls.

We roll dice because we want to be on the edge of our seats. We want to be surprised by where the story takes us next.

## Safety Tools

Safety at the table is very important, which is why we think that you should establish a couple of **Lines and Veils** before you start playing.

**Lines** are allow everyone in the group to define what topics should never come up in the game. **Veils** ensures that whilst an action or event might take place, it will happen ‘off-screen’: mentioned in passing, but not dwelled on in detail.

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important, and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

# Character Creation

Players play as Dreamers. To make your Dreamer, write down their name, their nickname, and what they look like on your character sheet.

## Actions

The way your character interacts with the world is via their actions. When a PC wants to do something risky, they use **one of the 12 actions** listed below to try and resolve the situation.

> #### Designer Notes: Hacking The Actions
>
> In HOPES & DREAMS, characters have the following 12 actions: muscle, finesse, move, sneak, shoot, tinker, study, notice, bond, command, sway, focus. An easy way to make this game your own is to change the default action list to something that better fits your theme.
>
> If you use less than 12 actions, you might want to reduce the number of actions characters are skilled in at the start of the game

- **Muscle**: wreck, move, force.
- **Finesse**: maneuver, misguide, fool.
- **Move**: run, jump, swim, climb.
- **Sneak**: hide, skulk, lurk.
- **Shoot**: track, throw, shoot.
- **Tinker**: build, repair, hijack.
- **Study**: gather information, analyze, scrutinize.
- **Notice**: perceive, observe, anticipate.
- **Bond**: reassure, socialize, connect.
- **Command**: lead, order, intimidate.
- **Sway**: influence, charm, manipulate.
- **Focus**: concentrate, calculate, mediate.

All characters have actions they excel at, this is called being _skilled_. **Characters are skilled in three actions total**.

To decide which action your character is skilled in, you first **choose a kit**. Kits are character presets that come with **two skilled actions** and **special abilities** that you can use to make powerful stunts. At character creation, you get to choose one ability from your kit as your starting ability.

Once you’ve chosen a kit, you get to decide what is the last action your character is skilled at, based on your preferences.

## Kits

There are **{N} kits** for the players to choose from.

> #### Designer Notes: Making Kits
>
> Kits are like HOPES & DREAMS’ playbooks. They show the readers what your game is about, and what kind of characters the players will play as. Use this as a way to convey your game’s theme as much as possible.
>
> To make a kit, give them a name, define actions they are skilled at and give them a couple of abilities.
>
> Abilities are like the talents of a kit. They can give new narrative permissions to a character. But can also make them stronger or more resistant by giving a +1 impact or -1 cost bonus to a roll in specific circumstances.

## Hopes

The _hope_ of a character is used to represent what fuels them to achieve their goals. Characters **gain hope** when they **succeed risky actions**. Players can then decide to spend that hope to get an extra die on their roll when facing challenges. The easiest way to track hope is to use physical tokens like poker chips or beads, but you can also use the hope track available on the character sheet to accomplish this.

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING HOPES
>
> HOPES is what fuels the characters in the story. It helps push the narrative forward so that the PCs can eventually reach their goal, and achieve their DREAMS.
>
> You should look into renaming this so that it better fits your game’s aesthetic.

## Dreams

Once everyone has a general idea of what kind of character they are going to play, you all need to decide on what is the main short-term goal of the group. We call this the group’s **_dream_**.

The dream is what drives the characters forward in the story. This isn’t something that is given to them, it’s something that drives them and ignites their hearts.

Once you’ve chosen a dream, one of the players can write it down on their character sheet for safe keeping. That character is called the **heart of the group**. They aren’t the leader, but they are responsible for **keeping the group’s dream alive**.

Some of the game’s mechanics mark boxes on the dream track to represent the progress that the group is making towards their dream. When the group's dream track is completed, the GM fast forwards in time and narrates how the story and the world changed thanks to the PCs. Accomplishing a dream also gives all the PCs a new ability that they can select from their respective **kits**.

After that, the group finds a **new dream**, and a different character can be elected to be the **new heart of the group**.

Then, the cycle starts over.

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING DREAMS
>
> A dream is the group’s short-term goal. It aligns everyone on the path to take. Plus, they have the group’s leader who’s there to make sure the goal is never forgotten.
>
> Fulfilling the group’s dream is not just important for the story, but it is also important mechanically.
>
> It is the only way players will see their characters grow stronger, since fulfilling a DREAM rewards a new ABILITY to every member of the group.

## Harm

When a PC gets hurt as a result of one of their actions, they take **_harm_**. Each character has a harm track with 5 boxes to represent the range of their injuries and their overall condition.

If at any point your character’s **harm track is filled**, you are **taken out**, and the rest of the scene continues without you. When the scene is over, clear the track and explain how you recover.

The only way to **recover** from harm is **in-fiction**. You can either rest, lay low or seek medical attention. When doing so, the GM will look at the fiction and tell you how much (1-5) harm you recover. Aspects that can affect how fast you recover range from the time you spend caring for your wounds, to the gear or expertise you seek to get better.

> #### Designer Notes: HACKING HARM
>
> Harm is the main challenge pacing mechanism for the game. The GM can inflict it on a player when they fail, or get a partial success, as they attempt dangerous actions.
>
> If you want to make the characters feel stronger or weaker, you can adjust the length of the harm track. Remember that failing a risky action can mark 1 box of harm, while failing a desperate one could mean marking 2. Take this in consideration and test your changes until you get the proper feeling for how you want the characters to feel in your game. In doubt, we still consider 5 boxes to be a good default value.
>
> To change the way harm work, you could also include more than one harm track, depending on what your game is about. Doing this will let you spread the pace over multiple tracks.

## Abilities

A character’s **_abilities_** are special talents that are unique to each kit. They either give a **mechanical advantage** in certain situations, or allow a new **narrative liberty**.

Each character starts with 1 ability from their kit, and get to choose a new one every time the **group’s dream is achieved**.

Fulfilling the group's dream is the main way for characters to grow stronger in the game. That's why it's important for the group to align themselves on a short-term goal that can be accomplished within a reasonable amount of time.

# Mechanics

## Tests & Challenges

If what the PC is trying to accomplish is something we would just expect them to do, the GM can just narrate what happens, and the story moves forward without the need for any dice roll. On the other hand, when a player character **tries to do something risky** or if the action is challenging, **they make a check** to determine how it plays out.

To make a check, the player **assembles a pool** of dice to try to **beat an opposed pool** assembled by the GM. The player’s pool represents the effort of their character to overcome a situation. The GM’s pool corresponds to the passive or active opposition that the character is up against. The result tells us about the _impact_ and the _cost_ of the action.

### Player’s Pool

The player **picks the _action_** that best describes what their character is trying to do and builds a dice pool. Every character starts with one d6 in the pool. If your character is **_skilled_** in the action, add another d6. You can also **spend 1 _hope_** to fill your heart with determination, and give it everything you’ve got to **add another d6**.

### GM’s Pool

To build a **_risk pool_**, the GM looks at the fiction and evaluates the risk tied to the action. While the GM has final say on this, they should run their decision by the rest of the group to make sure everyone is in agreement. For a **risky action, use 1d6**. For a **desperate action, use 2d6**. For a **hopeless action, use 3d6**.

By default, if a player is making a check, the situation is _risky_. When in doubt, look at the fiction, but keep in mind that a desperate or hopeless pool makes the odds heavily against the players.

#### Assist

If you want to assist a fellow PC in their action, describe how you do it, and choose if you want to **give +1 _impact_** or **-1 _cost_** to their final result.
Doing this is not without risk. When you assist a fellow PC in their task, you also expose yourself to the possible consequences that result from your combined efforts.

### Interpreting The Results

When everyone is ready, both the player and the GM roll their dice pools and compare the single highest result of their respective roll.

- If the **player beats the GM**, it’s a **success**. They get a **_payoff_ and 1 _hope_** if they didn’t spend any for their roll.
- If the **player ties with the GM**, it’s a **success at a cost**. They get a **_payoff_**, but there’s a **_consequence_**.
- If the **GM beats the player**, it’s a **failure**. The action didn’t work, and there’s a **_consequence_**.

The player and the GM then work together to figure out the type of _payoff_ and/or _consequence_ that should be used in this particular scenario.

## Using The Impact & The Cost

After a _check_, we use the number of dice from each pool as a rating to determine the outcome of the action.

### Impacts & Payoffs

We call the **size of the player’s pool the impact**, and use it to determine the effect of a successful action.

When a player gets a **_payoff_** as a result of their action, they choose one from the following:

- For a simple _check_, you get what you want.
- If there's a _challenge track_ in play, mark boxes matching the _impact_.
- If there’s a _danger track_ in play and the fiction allows it, clear boxes matching the _impact_.

### Cost & Consequences

We call the **size of the GM’s pool the cost**, and use it to determine the strength of a consequence prompted by an action.

When a roll creates a consequence, the GM chooses one from the following:

- Introduce something new and dangerous in the fiction.
- Inflict _harm_ matching the cost.
- If there's a _danger track_ in play and the fiction allows it, mark boxes matching the _cost_.

## Tracks

When there is a **simple problem** that needs to be overcome, we make a **single check** to determine how the story moves forward.

_Can you jump to this building? Can you convince this shop owner to give information? Can you take out this guard without anyone noticing? Can you force this door open?_

When the GM needs to track the ongoing effort of a **complex obstacle** that requires more time and dedication, we resolve the situation using a **challenge**.

The GM starts by explaining what the challenge is about, they then draw a **challenge track** made of **3, 5, 8 or 13 boxes** on an index card. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the track.

The PCs can attempt to resolve the challenge by doing checks to tick boxes to fill in the track. When all the boxes of the tracks are filled, the challenge is resolved and the story can continue its way.

_Can you fight off this intimidating group of thugs? Can you convince this panel of ministers that you are not guilty? Can you find enough clues to find the hinding spot of this criminal gang?_

## Danger Tracks

When the GM wants to increase the tension in a scene or hint at some impending danger, they can draw a **danger track** with **3, 5, 8 or 13 boxes** on an index card. The bigger the track, the longer it will take for the danger to happen.

When a check creates a **_consequence_**, the GM can use this as an opportunity to mark boxes on a danger track, thus making the danger one step closer to complicating the PC’s life.

# Guidelines

Here are a couple of tips and tricks you should read before you start playing the game.

## For GMs

- **Be a fan of the players.** You aren’t there to trap them or see them lose. You are there to help facilitate an interesting story. Be on the edge of your seat when they are challenged, and cheer when they succeed!
- **Don’t plan, play.** You don’t need to spend hours planning all the details of each and every session. No plan survives an encounter with the players, so save yourself some time and play to find out what happens instead.
- **When in doubt, ask questions.** The players have tons of wonderful ideas if you just listen to them. It’s OK to not know about everything. Ask your players questions and fill the world with their answers.
- **This is a game, not a simulation.** Everyone is here to have fun, so try to stay away from hyper-realism. If it looks cool and feels like it could be possible, let the players try. The dice will help guide you towards the rest of the story.

## For Players

- **Let everyone have their moment.** Everyone enjoys it when their character does something cool and the spotlight is on them. So for that reason, try to make sure everyone at the table gets a fair amount of screen time!
- **You are a writer, not a spectator.** The GM will help guide the story, but you are as much a part of the writing process as them. Embrace this narrative control and fill out the world with your ideas.
- **Take risks.** This isn’t like real life, you’re allowed to play dangerously. The only thing that will come out of you doing so, is a fantastic story. Don't be scared of engaging with the fiction.
- **Rise up.** When your character takes actions, they might fail or consequences might arise. But that’s OK, failure and consequences make for a more interesting story. When at first you don't succeed, get back up and try again using a new approach.

## Balancing Tracks

`TRACKS` are the core pacing mechanism in the game and understanding how their boxes are marked is crucial in understanding how to balance the challenges and treats in a session.

Players will generally want to make `CHECKS` when they are `SKILLED`. That means that the `{IMPACT}` of their roll will often be between 2 or 3.

On the other end, the GM will often have a `RISK POOL` with a `{COST}` of 1, sometimes 2 and rarely 3.

This discrepancy in favor of the player in there for statistical reasons. Though it means that the size of `CHALLENGE TRACKS` and `DANGER TRACKS` should be adjusted accordingly.

Making a `DANGER TRACK` with 8 segments will take a very long time to fill, while a CHALLENGE TRACK with only 3 segments will quickly be resolved by the players.

Generally speaking, to keep things relatively balanced, `DANGER TRACK`S should have between 3, 5 or 8 boxes.

For `CHALLENGE TRACKS`, you can easily go up to 5, 8 or even 13 boxes.

This is simply a guideline so you can consider this a good starting point when using `TRACKS`.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The number of boxes for **TRACKS** aren’t arbitrary. They follow the Fibonacci Sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc) where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The reason for this is that according to Weber’s Law, the difference we can identify between objects is given by a percentage. If that percentage is too low, differentiating two things becomes harder.

By making each **TRACK** size around 60% bigger than the previous one, deciding each one to use becomes easier. Doing this speeds up the game and keeps the group focused on what is important; the fiction.
