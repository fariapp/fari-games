## Features

- All the core rules of Charge, condensed in a half fold brochure format.
- A streamlined action list ready for pickup and play.
- A beautiful minimalist character sheet on the back cover of the document.
- Affinity Publisher and Google Docs templates for you to make your own Charge game using the Dash format.

# The Game

## Before We Start

Define lines that should not be crossed. Pause or rewind the game if something uncomfortable happens during a session. Always make sure everyone is comfortable with the direction of the story.

## Playing The Game

One person is the game master (GM), the rest are players.

**GM**: Guide the story, present challenges to the group. Be a fan of the players. Ask them questions, fill the world with their answers. If it's cool, let them try or split complex challenges into _clocks_.

**Player**: Narrate what your character does. Make _action rolls_ when things are risky. Give everyone a time to shine. Fill the world with your ideas. Take risks, and rise up from failures.

## Action Rolls

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, and there's a risk of failure, make an _action roll_. This resolves the action of the PC as well as any GM characters that are involved

GM, telegraph the _risk_ of the roll (low, moderate, high) and the _effect_ (limited, standard, great). Pick an _action_, roll 1d6 per action dot, and read the **single highest result**.

_If you end up with zero or less dice to roll, roll 2 dice and keep the lowest._

- On a **66**, it's a **critical success**. You achieve your goal with increased _effect_.
- On a **6**, it's a **full success**. You achieve your goal.
- On a **4-5**, it's a **partial success**. You achieve your goal, but there's a _consequence_.
- On a **1-3**, it's a **bad outcome**. Things go badly, and there's a _consequence_.

## Momentum

When a player makes an _action roll_, that roll can generate _momentum_. You start every session with 2, and generate more when you make successful rolls. You use _momentum_ to get various bonuses or resist incoming _consequences_.

- On a **4-5**, you gain 1 _momentum_.
- On a **6**, you gain 2 _momentum_.
- On a **66**, you gain 3 _momentum_.

_When momentum is spent for a roll, that roll cannot in turn generate momentum._

## Consequences

If you make an action roll, and you get a partial success (4-5) or a bad outcome (1-3), you suffer a consequence.

- **Reduced Effect** : reduce the _effect_ of the action by one level.
- **Complication**: tick 1-3 segments on a new or existing _danger clock_, based on the _risk_.
- **Escalated Risk**: increase the _risk_ of future related action rolls by one level.
- **Lost Opportunity** : what you tried didn't work, you need to use another _action_.
- **Worse Condition**: take 1-3 _stress_, based on the _risk_.

**STRESS**: When your character takes _stress_, tick segments on your _stress clock_. Update your character’s _condition_ beside the clock. If you fill the clock, clear it, and you are taken out for the scene. To recover _stress_, rest, lay low or seek medical attention. The GM will look at the fiction and tell you how much _stress_ (1-4) you clear.

**DETERMINATION ROLL**: To resist or limit your or someone else’s _consequence_, build a pool of d6s by adding 1d6 for each charge of _momentum_ you are willing to consume. Roll and take the highest result.

- On a **1-3,** the _consequence_ still happens.
- On a **4-5**, the _consequence_ is reduced.
- On a **6**, the _consequence_ is avoided.
- On a **66**, the _consequence_ is avoided, and the _risk_ of your next roll is lowered.

## Your Character

When creating a new character, write down their _details_:

- **Concept**: an elevator-pitch version of who the character is.
- **Appearance**: what the character looks like, what they wear, etc.
- **Ties**: 1-3 relations that the character has with certain people or organizations in the world.

Assign 4 _action dots_ among the following 6 _actions_ on your character sheets.

- **Muscle**: move, overcome, wreck.
- **Finesse**: hide, skulk, lurk.
- **Move**: run, jump, climb.
- **Study**: gather, scrutinize, analyze.
- **Talk**: befriend, charm, manipulate.
- **Focus**: concentrate, meditate, trance.

_At character creation, actions cannot have more than 2 dots._

**PROGRESSION**: After a big story event, every PC gets a new _talent_. This either gets you a new _action dot_, or a _situational talent_. For the latter, decide on a specific situation that activates the talent’s bonus and fill the blanks on your sheet.

## Challenges and Danger

When the PCs face a complex obstacle, like enemies putting up stiff resistance, or when you want to inject the tension of impending danger, don't leave it to a single action roll: draw a _clock_.

_Clocks_ are circles divided in 4, 6 or 8 segments. Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the _clock_.

When a PC tries to overcome an obstacle with an _action roll,_ tick a _progress clock_ with 1 segment for a _limited effect_, 2 segments for a _standard effect_, or 3 segments for a _great effect_.

When a PC gets a _complication_ as a result of their _action_, tick a _danger clock_ 1 segment for a _low risk_, 2 segments for a _moderate risk_, or 3 segments for a _high risk_.

## Special Actions

**PUSH YOURSELF**: Consume 2 _momentum_ per push and gain one of the following.

- Add 1d6 to your _action roll_.
- Increase the _effect_ of your action.
- Take action even if you were _taken out_.

**ASSIST**: Consume 1 _momentum_ to add 1d6 to an ally’s roll. Doing this also exposes your character to the same risks.

**ADD TENSION**: Ask the GM to add a _consequence_ to the scene. If you accept it, add 1d6 to your _action roll_.

**SET UP**: Make an _action roll_ to improve the _effect_ or _risk_ for people following through with your _action_.

**PROTECT**: Step in to confront a _consequence_ that an ally would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene, and suffer the _consequence_ for them. You can try to reduce or cancel the _consequence_ with a _determination roll_.

**FLASHBACKS**: Call for a scene that has happened in the past to affect what hasn’t been established in the fiction yet. The GM sets a cost in _momentum_, between 0-2, and asks for _action rolls_ if necessary.

**FORTUNE ROLL**: To disclaim decision making, you can make a _fortune roll_. The result of the roll helps guide the outcome as to where the story goes next, but doesn't feature _momentum_ nor _consequences_. Roll a number of d6s based on a specific _action_ or the odds of a thing happening, and interpret the results.
